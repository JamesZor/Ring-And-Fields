# Ring Theory Course

This repository contains materials for the Ring Theory course. The course aims to provide students with a solid foundation in ring theory, covering various topics such as basic concepts of rings, quotient rings, ideals, integral domains, fields, and factorization in unique factorization domains. Additionally, the course delves into elementary field theory and the construction of finite fields.

## Course Objective

Upon completion of this course, students will be able to:
- Understand basic concepts of ring theory, including rings, homomorphisms, ideals, integral domains, fields, units, zero divisors, principal ideal domains (PID), Euclidean domains, and unique factorization domains (UFD).
- Solve problems involving ring theory concepts in explicit situations.
- Apply knowledge of quotient rings, prime/maximal ideals, and related theorems (such as the 1st isomorphism theorem and the Chinese remainder theorem) to solve problems in specific scenarios.
- Determine factorizations in certain UFDs using irreducibility tests.
- Apply elementary field theory principles, such as algebraic extensions, degrees of extensions, splitting fields, and finite fields, to practical situations.

## Course Content

The course covers the following topics:
1. Definition of rings: units, zero divisors, subrings, integral domains, and fields, with illustrative examples.
2. Ideals and generators.
3. Quotient rings and isomorphism theorems.
4. The Chinese remainder theorem for rings.
5. Polynomial rings: roots, division with remainder (in one variable).
6. Prime ideals and maximal ideals.
7. Principal ideal domains, Euclidean domains, and unique factorization domains.
8. Factorization of polynomials and Eisenstein's criterion.
9. Field extensions and degrees of field extensions.
10. Finite fields.
